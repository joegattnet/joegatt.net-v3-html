                       <a href="../../../pantography.html">Pantography</a> takes brute force to the alphabet and generates one text after another. Although each one is born in the most banal way possible, it will eventually have amassed billions upon billions of texts that will be impossible to tell apart
              
                       <a href="63.html#annotation-3" id="annotation-mark-3">3</a> from those written by human authors. It would also be possible, of course, to modify Pantography’s algorithm to generate only texts which are grammatically, syntactically, lexicographically and orthographically coherent by current understanding.
              
                       <a href="63.html#annotation-4" id="annotation-mark-4">4</a> The entire body of texts thus produced could then be mistaken for one produced by someone with an extraordinary amount of time on their hands, some sort of prisoner of eternity.

                     <p id="paragraph-3">There are other ways of getting a machine to produce texts, without using the indiscriminate strategy of Pantography’s incremental method. Quill, for instance, is a software program developed by 
              
                       <a href="https://narrativescience.com/">Narrative Science</a> which analyses a set of data and writes up a nifty little paragraph about its most significant points.
              
                       <a href="63.html#annotation-5" id="annotation-mark-5">5</a> So far it is mostly used to report on regional sports events, real estate trends and

                     </p>
                     <blockquote> Wall Street is expecting higher profit for Celgene when the company reports its second quarter results on Thursday, July 25, 2013. The consensus estimate is calling for profit of $1.44 a share, a rise from $1.22 per share a year ago. For the fiscal year, analysts are expecting earnings of $5.77 per share.

                     <p id="paragraph-4">Perfunctory, yes. But surely no worse than the following excerpt from Reuters, written, one presumes, by a human being:</p>
                     <blockquote> Celgene Corp announced that for fiscal 2013, it raises adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a range of $5.80-$5.90 from the previous range of $5.55 to $5.65, an increase of approximately 19% over fiscal 2012 adjusted diluted EPS. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.17-$4.31 which includes upfront payment expense for collaborations.

                     <p id="paragraph-5">Quill operates within a narrowly defined set of data and, so far, produces texts in a genre where standardised formulations are the norm. But it is already possible to see how its specialisations and applications will become ever broader. It’s not impossible to imagine it filing a perfectly serviceable analysis of an election result some years from now. Kristian Hammond, CTO at Narrative Science, has no lack of ambition for his child, predicting that it will win a Pulitzer by 2017 and that by 2027, “more than 90%" of news will be written by computers.
              
                       <a href="63.html#annotation-8" id="annotation-mark-8">8</a>
                     </p>
                     <p id="paragraph-6">Hammond probably has in mind journalism with 
              
                       <a href="https://narrativescience.com/artificial-intelligence-data-engine/#section1">a more or less straightforward methodology</a>: a piece of text that begins with a body of data—both foreground and background—identifies its most relevant aspects, contextualises it with some historical comparisons and then strings together a story. But it would be foolish to think that the same method cannot be applied to work that is normally assumed requires more imagination. As it is, Quill can probably write a perfectly readable chosistic novel in the style of Alain Robbe-Grillet. Or maybe the kind of coldly descriptive prose that Robert Musil was going for in 
              
                       <a href="../../../citations/167.html">the opening paragraph</a> of The Man Without Qualities. Raymond Roussell’s procédé is an algorithm waiting to be automated. All writing begins with a body of data, at the very least the author’s own experience of the world, and text is a way of generalising and summarising the data.
              
                       <a href="63.html#annotation-9" id="annotation-mark-9">9</a> Metaphor, irony, pathos, humour—these can all be “programmed in”
              
                       <a href="63.html#annotation-10" id="annotation-mark-10">10</a>. After all, they are rhetorical methods whose mechanics have been studied at least as far back as the Greeks.
              
                     </p>
                     <p id="paragraph-7">In his essay Cybernetics and Ghosts
              
                       <a href="63.html#annotation-11" id="annotation-mark-11">11</a>, Italo Calvino, himself a collector and editor of Italian folk tales, welcomed the structuralists’ decipherment of the constitutive elements of myth that would eventually give us a sort of alphabet to work from. A distillation of narrative into its most basic buildings blocks, out of which any other story could be generated.
              
                       <a href="63.html#annotation-12" id="annotation-mark-12">12</a> This sounds a lot like the “Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence” of symbolic manipulation that Hubert Dreyfus and others railed against in the 1970s, and the fashion has since moved on to a more heuristic approach that, rather than following an a priori procedure, learns to draw approximate inferences from given data. It is not impossible to imagine such a  heuristic program using an enormous body of existing texts to learn how language is used and then have a go itself like a bright adolescent spending an uneventful summer omnivorously going through the local library and then, with the first rains of September, sitting down to write her first short story.
              
                     </p>
                     <p id="paragraph-8">At this point, many would take consolation in re-categorisation, in finding ever more remote trap-doors and priest-holes where the Human Spirit can hide. They will console themselves with the notion there will always be something quintessentially human that machine writing cannot reproduce. This used to be the received wisdom about computer chess programs. It was believed that a grandmaster’s wit and ingenuity, his humanity, will always ensure that a computer will never ultimately beat the best human opponents
              
                       <a href="63.html#annotation-13" id="annotation-mark-13">13</a>. And then the Human Era of chess ended on 11 May 1997 when IBM’s 
              
                       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer)">Deep Blue</a> won the second six-game match against Garry Kasparov. In the predictable acrimony that ensued, Kasparov accused IBM of cheating, on the grounds that he had detected creativity in the machine’s play—surely, he declared, a sign of human intervention!
              
                       <a href="63.html#annotation-14" id="annotation-mark-14">14</a> That Wired article on Narrative Science, in its final paragraphs, sought to reassure panicking humanists that any Pulitzer on offer would be given not to the algorithm itself, of course, but to its coders. While one can certainly imagine an application that would be used by human authors to write fiction algorithmically, just as some musicians use 
              
                       <a href="https://supercollider.sourceforge.net/">SuperCollider</a> to create algorithmic music
              
                       <a href="63.html#annotation-15" id="annotation-mark-15">15</a> there is no reason to believe that there will never be a successor of Quill that is so autonomous that its output will be as attributable to its coders as The Handmaid’s Tale is to the programmers of Microsoft Word, or The Charterhouse of Parma to a duck’s arse.
              
                     </p>
                     <p id="paragraph-9">Calvino, on the other hand, cheerfully welcomed the prospect of machines taking over the task of writing—precisely because then, "
              
                       <a href="../../../citations/999999.html">the decisive moment of literary life will be that of reading</a>". But Calvino was flattering us, thinking us as humble and sophisticated as himself.
              
                       <a href="63.html#annotation-16" id="annotation-mark-16">16</a> He describes us all as if we have long been impatient to be rid of this distasteful burden of “self-expression”, to devote ourselves fully, like consecrated monks, to the one role in literature that has humility and dignity, that of the reader. That we have longed to abandon the kitchen for the dining room, gracious guests at the magnificent table of literature.

                     <p id="paragraph-10">As things stand, we are still stoically peeling onions among the gurgling pots in the kitchen. 
              
                       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Books_published_per_country_per_year">Several million books are published every year</a>. These are books that real live human beings conceived of, researched, planned, discussed, and then typed and re-typed with their own hands, often for little or no reward. Quill, and all the other machine-writing programs that will succeed it, are solutions for a problem that does not exist. Whatever the motivation, the production of texts is clearly a task that 
              
                       <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-25139244">we are very happy to do for ourselves</a>. And even if we ever do get fully serviceable writing machines, one suspects that after a brief fad of automation, we will want to return to hand-making our texts. Just as we did with mashed potatoes.

                       <a href="63.html#annotation-18" id="annotation-mark-18">18</a> it will become ever harder for writers to find readers prepared to read their texts, or even to find any literate person who is not so occupied with their own writing that they have any time for reading.
              
                       <a href="63.html#annotation-19" id="annotation-mark-19">19</a> More and more texts will die the unconsummated death of the slush-pile. We don’t need a machine for writing—what we need is a machine for reading.

                     <p id="paragraph-12">When Friedrich Nietzsche first obtained a typewriter, he was overwhelmed by the speed with which he could now produce texts. Or rather, he found that his friends, his initial readers, were overwhelmed: “What I really need is a machine that can read what I produce.”
              
                       <a href="63.html#annotation-20" id="annotation-mark-20">20</a>
                     </p>
                     <p id="paragraph-13">It’s hard to imagine what Nietzsche could have thought such a machine would look like. He had just taken delivery of an upright Danish typewriter, made of clunky keys and springs.
              
                       <a href="63.html#annotation-21" id="annotation-mark-21">21</a> Surely he couldn’t have thought that by a different, more ingenious arrangement of these mechanical parts, a machine for reading could be devised?
              
                     </p>
                     <p id="paragraph-14">In fact, even with our vastly greater familiarity with machines that seem to perform uncanny tasks, that can place us anywhere in the world and carry our voice and image dutifully across oceans, it remains almost impossible, even on the level of a thought experiment, to imagine what a reading machine would look like.</p>
                     <p id="paragraph-15">We can imagine a writing machine simply by extrapolating from current technologies, by imagining machines that become ever subtler, ever more complex until their methods are impossible to distinguish from the normal artifice of authorship. Writing can be faked; because once the text is produced we are able to take it at face value. It is often irresistible to infer the mind of the author from what we read but that is all post hoc. Language can be produced even accidentally, and carried naively.
              
                       <a href="63.html#annotation-22" id="annotation-mark-22">22</a> After all, a whole realm of meaning is produced by misspelling, mispronunciation and malapropism.
              
                     </p>
                     <p id="paragraph-16">But it is impossible to imagine a reading machine. After all, we already have simple writing machines but we don’t have equivalent machines that can read these simple texts. Except in the Chinese Room sense that machines read data from each other, that our computer reads data from a memory stick.</p>
                     <p id="paragraph-17">Or, rather, it is impossible to imagine a reading machine without imagining a fully conscious machine. We can perhaps imagine a sort of network whose “reading” feeds back into life, through which we can influence the world. Or one that, having read our texts, goes on to produce further texts under their influence. But can we imagine a machine that gives us authorial fulfilment when it reads our texts?</p>
                     <p id="paragraph-18">In fact, the reason why we don’t consider Quill’s texts to have been “authored” but rather “produced” or, at best, “written,” is because these machines, and their foreseeable successors, can’t read what they’re writing. 
              
                       <a href="63.html#annotation-23" id="annotation-mark-23">23</a> It’s not primarily their shortcomings as writers that disqualify them, but their shortcomings as readers, their lack of subjectivity as readers. Maybe, when we do have writing machines, we will start treating the provenance of the texts to be as mystical, as incorporeal, as the fruits of the muses once were.
              
                       <a href="63.html#annotation-24" id="annotation-mark-24">24</a> Indeed, if we assume the machines producing the texts to be merely naive carriers then it would be very hard to not infer, however wrongly, a deeper source, a truer origin, an “intelligent designer.”
              
                     </p>
                     <p id="paragraph-19">But the compelling need for just such a reading machine will impel us to build one. First we will have to imagine it. Time has taught us that tasks that seem uniquely human tend to appear more mechanistic once we have learnt to automate them. Nietzsche spoke of his typewriter anthropomorphically, whereas to us it appears as a merely mechanical device. The feat of beating a Chess grandmaster was considered a uniquely human ability until we managed to reduce it to a heuristic process. The mysterious act of translation is carried out with increasing competence using probablistic methods. Maybe we will manage to create a reading machine, and it will appear as banal a task as geolocation. We continue to mechanise tasks that we once considered “intelligent,” and redefine intelligence as something ever more elusive.

                     <p id="paragraph-21">This Mechanical Turk and its fully automated successors could become a built-in part of our word-processors such that once we have written a text, it is also instantly read and its entire life-cycle—from conception to production to consummation—happens instantaneously. It could be plugged directly into Creative Writing departments.

                       <ins>We can imagine a machine—which is to say an AI—that performs many of the tasks we associate with the reader. We can imagine a specialist AI, for instance, that knows what kind of articles we find interesting and selects for us other articles that we might find interesting. Assuming that we normally select and highlight our reading material as a form of deferral of reading, that we bookmark articles instead of reading, in the same way that we once recorded shows on a VCR instead of watching them
