It can be observed from the outside, as a behavioural phenomenon—a theory of reading without a theory of mind\n    \u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","marker_title":"The Reading Machine Revisited"},{"lat":null,"lng":null,"infowindow":"\u003cdiv class=\"infowindow\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/texts/266\"\u003e\n    \u003ch2\u003e\n      Writers and their Professions\n      \n    \u003c/h2\u003e\n    The compulsion to write is a mysterious one. After all, there’s something suspect, something unattractive and childish about wanting to impose your words on others, lashing your every passing sensation to the alphabet. The invitation to read one’s particular arrangement of words, therefore, always comes circumscribed, with excessively humble titles and self-lacerating prefaces. In more...\n    \u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","marker_title":"Writers and their Professions"},{"lat":null,"lng":null,"infowindow":"\u003cdiv class=\"infowindow\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/texts/149\"\u003e\n    \u003ch2\u003e\n      Text 149\n      \n    \u003c/h2\u003e\n    This does not exist only for books, it exists for any reproducible work. We can say this not only of “book” but also of “film”, “record” and so on.   In this sense, Benjamin’s famous assertion that reproduced work differs from our older notions of art in that it has no aura can be turned on its head: reproduced work leads us to suspect the existence of an ideal...\n    \u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","marker_title":"Text 149"},{"lat":null,"lng":null,"infowindow":"\u003cdiv class=\"infowindow\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"/texts/304\"\u003e\n    \u003ch2\u003e\n      “I will come back and I will be millions”\n      \n    \u003c/h2\u003e\n    Already in 1936 Walter Benjamin could write that even the existence of Letters to the Editor had changed the whole game.
